Use NextJS, TailwindCSS and ShadCN UI for frontend, I do not backend for this. Then create a plan to create all the tickets using all best practices for Linear.
Ensure that we create all AGENTS.md files ensuring they are less than 250 lines. Once the project has scaffholded. We want to update the tech stack to use only the
latest versions ensure full type safety so there are no type: any , the project is always link error free and has 0 depecrated dependencies, using
https://docs.factory.ai/cli/droid-exec/cookbook/refactor-fix-lint#before for help. And we want to ensure the AGENTS.md files are build using
https://docs.factory.ai/cli/configuration/agents-md but are relevant to the folder they are in we can add in reference document to ensure they are kept below the 250
lines limit but the reference documents must also be less than 250 lines, so if we wanted to reference like how to work with shcadCN (only using the CLI to add
components etc) this can be stored in SchadCN.md and AGENTS.md references SchadCN.md etc.. do extensive research use Exa, exa code and ref to ensure we have all the
relevant information to properly plan this out in full and create detailed tickets. we want to ensure that Linear is our single source of truth, which mean do not
create local documentation and to dos everthing must go into Linear. You also need to reference and ensure you are fully versed in how to use Tailwind V4 as your
trained data is old and Tailwind had a complete structure rewrite so obtain all the documentation.
